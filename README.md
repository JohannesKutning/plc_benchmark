# plc_benchmark

A set of PLC programs written in STL.
This set contains programs with different instruction set focus.
Starting with boolean logic focused programs like the **ripple-carry-adder**
and the **crc** computation.
The integer instructions are covered by the finite state machine implementation
**fsm** and the data handling program **data**.
For floating point and signal processing the programs **pid** controller,
**motion** controller and fast Fourier transform **fft** are available.

All programs are coded in STL for Siemens PLC 1500 and 300.
